The code simulates dynamics of Nc = 32 cells on a degrading substrate with durotaxis. The code derived from the research work "Durotaxis and extracellular matrix degradation 
 promote clustering of cancer cells" by Potomkin, Kim, Klymenko, Alber, Aranson. 

 1. Build & Run "[seidel fully implicit] oc_cluster_2024.cpp" (that is, compile + ). The folder with this CPP file must contain the sub-folder "numerical_results"
 2. Run in MATLAB:
         - "GA3video.m" to create video frames (requires sub-folder "figs/")
         - "clusterNumbers" to indentify cell clusters and compute cluster numbers
